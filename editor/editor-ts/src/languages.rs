//! Per-language `TsLanguage` bundles, gated by cargo features.
//!
//! [`bundle`] returns a fully-populated [`crate::TsLanguage`] for one
//! [`Language`]. They are stubs in this crate — the actual
//! `tree-sitter-{rust,python,javascript,…}` crates are intentionally **not**
//! depended on, because pulling them all in roughly doubles CI build time
//! and most consumers want only one or two.
//!
//! # Wiring a real grammar (host instructions)
//!
//! In the host's `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! editor-ts = { version = "…", features = ["lang-rust"] }
//! tree-sitter-rust = "0.21"
//! ```
//!
//! Then in this file replace the `Language::Rust` arm's panic with the real
//! bundle:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! Language::Rust => TsLanguage {
//!     language: tree_sitter_rust::LANGUAGE.into(),
//!     highlights_query: tree_sitter_rust::HIGHLIGHTS_QUERY.to_string(),
//!     injections_query: Some(tree_sitter_rust::INJECTIONS_QUERY.to_string()),
//!     indent_query: None,
//! },
//! ```
//!
//! Hosts may also bypass this helper entirely and construct a
//! [`crate::TsLanguage`] by hand — useful when a grammar lives in a
//! private crate or when the highlights query is customized.
